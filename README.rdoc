== Beers - Lovingly Built with Rails and Angular

This application was built to exemplify a basic Rails application using Angular to 
handle basic CRUD (minus the U for the moment) functionality. This application uses the WIP coffeescript helper
library NGHelper and RailsResource to make Rails development with Angular quick, easy and (most importantly) fun.

This is just an example of my personal happy-path when developing with Rails and Angular. All comments, requests, etc welcome!
